      In JavaScript, let and const declarations are hoisted but not initialized.
      This means that the variables declared with let and const are hoisted to
      the top of their block scope, but they are not initialized with a value
      until the actual declaration statement is reached in the code. This
      behavior is often referred to as "temporal dead zone".

    <p id="letExample"></p>

    <script>
      // Example 1: Let declaration is hoisted but not initialized
      console.log(a); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
      let a = 10;

      // Example 2: Let declaration within a block is hoisted but not initialized
      console.log(b); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
      {
        let b = 20;
      }

      // Example 3: Let declaration in a loop is hoisted but not initialized
      for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2
      }

      // Example 4: Let declaration in a loop is hoisted but not initialized
      console.log(i); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined
    </script>

    <h2>Const Hoisting</h2>
    <p id="constExample"></p>

    <script>
      // Example 5: Const declaration is hoisted but not initialized
      console.log(c); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization
      const c = 30;

      // Example 6: Const declaration within a block is hoisted but not initialized
      console.log(d); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'd' before initialization
      {
        const d = 40;
      }

      // Example 7: Const declaration in a loop is hoisted but not initialized
      for (const j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        console.log(j); // Output: 0, 1, 2
      }

      // Example 8: Const declaration in a loop is hoisted but not initialized
      console.log(j); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: j is not defined
