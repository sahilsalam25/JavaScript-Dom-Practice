    <h1>Async-Await</h1>
    <h4>
      JavaScript is Synchronous in nature which means that it has an event loop
      that allows you to queue up an action that wonâ€™t take place until the loop
      is available sometime after the code that queued the action has finished
      executing. But there are a lot of functionalities in our program that make
      our code Asynchronous and one of them is the Async/Await functionality.
    </h4>
    <h3>
      Async/Await is the extension of promises that we get as support in the
      language.<br />

      What is Async Function ? Async simply allows us to write promises-based
      code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the
      execution thread.
      <br />
      Async functions will always return a value. It makes sure that a promise
      is returned and if it is not returned then JavaScript automatically wraps
      it in a promise which is resolved with its value.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      <b> What is Await Function ?</b>
      Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within
      the async block only. It makes the code wait until the promise returns a
      result.
