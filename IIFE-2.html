      IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It is a
      JavaScript design pattern that allows a function to execute immediately
      after itâ€™s defined. This pattern is commonly used to create a local scope
      for variables, preventing them from polluting the global scope.
      <br />

      Here's a simple example of an IIFE:

    <p>
      Converting Functions to IIFEs... <br />

      As we have already seen what an IIFE is and how its syntaxial form can be
      broken down to make more sense, We can convert a regular function into an
      IIFE following only two steps as follows. <br />

      Given any regular function definition, wrap the definition within a closed
      pair of parentheses, this will create your Function Expression. <br />
      Lastly, add another pair of parentheses and a semicolon to mark the end of
      the statement, and you have converted your regular Function into an IIFE.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      IIFEs have their own scope i.e. the variables you declare in the Function
      Expression will not be available outside the function.<br />
      Similarly to other functions IIFEs can also be named or anonymous, but
      even if an IIFE does have a name it is impossible to refer/invoke it.<br />
      IIFEs can also have parameters. For example, <br />

    <h3>Use Cases Of IIFE</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid polluting the global namespace</li>
      <li>To create closures</li>
      <li>Avoid conflict of variable names between libraries and programs.</li>
      <li>IIFE is used to create private and public variables and methods</li>
      <li>It is used to execute the async and await function</li>
      <li>It is used in JQuery Library</li>
      <li>It is used to work with require function</li>
    </ul>

    <script>
      // Declaring the parameter required.
      (function (dt) {
        console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());
        // Passing the Parameter.
      })(new Date());

      // Regular Function.
      function Greet() {
        console.log(
          "Using Normal Function\n Welcome to Normal Function CODE...!"
        );
      }
      // Execution of Regular Function.
      Greet();

      // IIFE creation and execution.
      (function () {
        console.log("Using IIFE Function\nWelcome to IIFE CODE...");
      })();
      // we can pass parameter also in IIFE...
      (function printName(name) {
        console.log("Name = ", name);
      })("Abdul Salam");
      // we can write multiple IIFE Function's...
      (function printName(name) {
        console.log("Name = ", name);
      })("Amir Salam"); // important ...while writing more than one or  multiple IIFE Function's use ; semicolon
      (function printName(name) {
        console.log("Name = ", name);
      })("Sahil Salam");
