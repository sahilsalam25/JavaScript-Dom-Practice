<!-- Event Delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently. Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element, we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .target property of the event object. -->

      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
      <li>Item 4</li>

      // Attaching event listener to the parent ul element
      document
        .getElementById("parent-list")
        .addEventListener("click", function (event) {
          // Checking if the clicked element is an li element
          if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
            // Perform action on li elements
            console.log("You clicked on:", event.target.textContent);

<!-- Above is an example:
Here's how it works:

Attach Event Listener to Ancestor Element: You attach an event listener to a common ancestor of the elements you're interested in. This could be the document object or any other parent element that contains the elements you want to track.

Check Target Element: When the event occurs, the event object contains information about the target element on which the event was triggered (event.target).

Delegate Action Based on Target Element: You check the event.target to determine if it matches the specific elements you're interested in. If it does, you perform the desired action. -->
