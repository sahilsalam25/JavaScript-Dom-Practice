      Promise chaining in JavaScript is a technique used to handle asynchronous
      operations in a sequential and organized manner. When you have multiple
      asynchronous tasks that depend on the results of each other, promise
      chaining allows you to execute them one after the other.
      <hr />

      Here's an example of how promise chaining works:
      <br />
    </h2>
    <script>
      // Function that returns a promise to simulate an asynchronous operation
      function asyncOperation1() {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Operation 1 completed");
          }, 1000);
        });
      }

      // Another function that returns a promise
      function asyncOperation2() {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Operation 2 completed");
          }, 1500);
        });
      }

      // Chaining promises
      asyncOperation1()
        .then((result1) => {
          console.log(result1);
          return asyncOperation2(); // Returning another promise
        })
        .then((result2) => {
          console.log(result2);
          console.log("All operations completed");
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error("An error occurred:", error);
        });

      //In this example: explanations...

      // asyncOperation1() is called, which returns a promise.
      // .then() is chained to the promise returned by asyncOperation1(). Inside the .then() block, result1 represents the resolved value from the first promise. Another asynchronous operation, asyncOperation2(), is invoked within this .then() block.
      // .then() is chained again to the promise returned by asyncOperation2(). Inside this .then() block, result2 represents the resolved value from the second promise.
      // If any of the promises are rejected (e.g., due to an error), .catch() will handle the error.
      // Promise chaining helps to avoid the "callback hell" and makes asynchronous code more readable and maintainable by organizing the flow of operations in a linear way.
    </script>
