    <h2>function expression in JS...</h2>
    <h3>
      A function expression in JavaScript is a way to define a function as part
      of an expression, usually by assigning it to a variable. Unlike function
      declarations, which are hoisted to the top of the scope, function
      expressions are not hoisted. They are evaluated at runtime, like any other
      expression.<br />

      Here's an example of a function expression:
    </h3>
    <h5>
      const add = function(a, b) {<br />
      return a + b;<br />
      };<br />

      console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5<br />
    </h5>
    <p>
      In this example:<hr />

      We define a function using the function keyword, but instead of using a
      function declaration (where the function name comes before the
      parentheses), we assign the function to a variable add.<hr />
      This function is anonymous because it doesn't have a name, but it's
      assigned to the variable add.<hr />
      We can then use the add variable to call the function, passing arguments 2
      and 3.<hr />
      This function expression is only available after the line where it's
      defined; it's not hoisted like function declarations.<hr />
    </p>
    <h3>Function expressions are commonly used in scenarios where functions are passed as arguments to other functions (higher-order functions), or in situations where you want to create a function conditionally or within a block of code.</h3>
    <h2>Difference bw function & function expression?
        <hr>
        The main difference between a function declaration and a function expression lies in how and when they are defined and hoisted.</h2>
        <p>
            Function Declaration:<br>

A function declaration defines a named function using the function keyword.<br>

Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.<br> This allows you to call the function before it's defined in the code.<br>

Here's an example of a function declaration:<br>
<h4>
    function add(a, b) {<br>
        return a + b;<br>
      }
      
</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            Function Expression:<br>

A function expression defines a function as part of an expression, usually by assigning it to a variable.<br>

Function expressions are not hoisted like function declarations. They are evaluated at runtime, like any other expression.<br>

Function expressions can be named (in which case they can be used within the function itself for recursion or better stack traces) or anonymous (where they are assigned to a variable without a name).<br>

Here's an example of a named function expression:<br>
<h3>
    const add = function(a, b) {<br>
        return a + b;<br>
      };
      <h1>And here's an example of an anonymous function expression:</h1>
      <h3>
        const subtract = function(a, b) {<br>
            return a - b;<br>
          };
          
      </h3>
      
</h3>
        </p>
        <h1 style="color:deepskyblue">In summary:...</h1>
        <p>
      <ul>     
<li>

Function declarations are defined using the function keyword and are hoisted to the top of their scope.</li>
<li>Function expressions are defined as part of an expression and are <b style="color: rgb(36, 159, 180);"> not hoisted</b>. They can be named or anonymous and are often assigned to variables.</li></ul>
