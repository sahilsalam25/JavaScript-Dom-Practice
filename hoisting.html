      Hoisting in JavaScript is a mechanism where variable and function
      declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the
      compile phase, before the code is executed. This means that regardless of
      where variables and functions are declared within their scope, they are
      treated as if they are declared at the top.

      However, it's important to note that only the declarations themselves are
      hoisted, not the initializations or assignments. Let's see how hoisting
      works with variables and functions:

      However, it's important to note that function expressions are not hoisted
      like function declarations. Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not
      the assignment of the function expression to the variable. So, with
      function expressions, you'll still encounter a reference error if you try
      to call them before they're defined.

    <h2>Variable Hoisting</h2>
    <p id="variableExample"></p>

    <script>
      // Example 1: Variable declaration is hoisted
      console.log(x); // Output: undefined
      var x = 5;
      console.log(x); // Output: 5

      // Example 2: Function declaration is hoisted
      console.log(sayHello()); // Output: "Hello!"
      function sayHello() {
        return "Hello!";
      }

      // Example 3: Function declaration overrides variable declaration
      var y = 10;
      function y() {}
      console.log(typeof y); // Output: "function"

      // Example 4: Variable declaration within a block
      console.log(z); // Output: undefined
      {
        var z = 20;
      }
      console.log(z); // Output: 20
    </script>

    <h2>Function Hoisting</h2>
    <p id="functionExample"></p>

    <script>
      // Example 5: Function declaration is hoisted
      sayHi(); // Output: "Hi!"
      function sayHi() {
        document.getElementById("functionExample").innerText = "Hi!";
      }
